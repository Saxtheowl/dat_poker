from http://compsci.ca/v3/viewtopic.php?t=19389 (( google search : proper c++ code ))

- Do not separately declare and initialize variables unless absolutely necessary.  
- Do not put space between function names and the parentheses surrounding the argument list. 
- Do not declare variables before necessary. 
- Precede and follow control structures (if/else, loops, switch) with a blank line to distinguish them from following code. 
- Variables (and member variables) as well as functions and member functions should be either like_this or likeThis.
